# üó∫Ô∏è UK Postcode Lookup Builder (Power Query)

This project builds a consolidated **postcode lookup table** using open data from the **Office for National Statistics (ONS)** and the **Register of Geographic Codes (RGC)**.  
It‚Äôs designed for use in Power BI / Power Query pipelines where postcode data is needed to join CRM or service data to current UK geographic areas (Local Authority, Region, Constituency, etc.).

---

## üìã Overview

The Power Query script [`PostcodeLookup.pq`](PostcodeLookup.pq) automates the process of:

1. Loading the **ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD)** ‚Äî or, optionally, the **National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL)**.
2. Joining related **Register of Geographic Codes** (UK and Scotland) to enrich each postcode with readable names.
3. Filtering out postcodes terminated before a configurable date (default: January 2013).
4. Producing a single, clean table ready to load into Power BI or other analytical tools.

Output column set includes postcode, key codes (LAD, ward, region, etc.), human-readable area names, coordinates, and a flag for ‚Äúlive‚Äù postcodes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the parameters at the top of `PostcodeLookup.pq`:

```m
SharePointRoot = "https://exampletenant.sharepoint.com/sites/exampleworkspace",
FolderPath = "ReferenceData/Postcode",
RGC_Scotland_File = "Register_of_Geographic_Codes_Scotland.xlsx",
RGC_UK_File = "Register_of_Geographic_Codes_UK.xlsx",
Postcode_File = "ONSPD_UK.csv",
FilterYear = 2013
```

> **Note:**  
> Never commit real tenant URLs or credentials to a public repository.  
> Replace them with placeholders or use a local `config.json` that you `.gitignore`.

## üîÑ Updating the Data

1. **Download the latest ONSPD or NSPL files**
   - Visit the [Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/).
   - Search for **‚ÄúONSPD‚Äù** or **‚ÄúNSPL‚Äù** and select the latest quarterly release (ZIP file).
   - Extract the CSV file (e.g., `ONSPD_AUG_2025_UK.csv`) into your local or SharePoint `ReferenceData/Postcode` folder.

2. **Download updated RGC files**
   - UK register (Excel): [ONS RGC June 2025](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/da3fb8af12e842a69255b0d21116bcaa/about)
   - Scotland register (Excel): [Scottish Government RGC](https://www.gov.scot/publications/geography-code-register-for-official-statistics/)

3. **Update filenames** in the `.pq` script if the file names change (for example `ONSPD_MAY_2026.csv`).

4. **Refresh the Power Query** to rebuild the lookup table with new data.

## üß† Notes and Best Practice

- Keep both **live** and **terminated** postcodes if you need historical data linkage.  
  For current reporting, the default filter keeps postcodes terminated after 2013 or still active.
- You can switch to the NSPL dataset by adjusting the source CSV and column names.  
  The overall logic remains the same.
- ONS releases new versions quarterly (typically February, May, August, and November).  
  It‚Äôs good practice to store both the raw files and the resulting processed table for reproducibility.
